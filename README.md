This Jupyter Notebook implements an anomaly detection system using Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) on the UCSD dataset. The UCSD dataset consists of video sequences capturing various scenes with both normal and abnormal activities, making it suitable for anomaly detection tasks. The goal of the system is to detect unusual patterns or anomalies in the video sequences, which could indicate potential security threats, safety hazards, or abnormal behavior.
